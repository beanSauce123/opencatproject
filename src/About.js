At the end, I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in medicine\n\n(quite the plot twist, isn't it?). My goal is to use the 3D dev skills I learned to create the first comprehensive,\n\nstudent-led, (and most importantly) free resource for the MCAT and general study. The aim is not to create\n\ncluttered, elaborate visuals that distract from the main point - rather, I will keep it simple and clear. New content\n\nwill be posted on a weekly basis, and I intend to add a search/filter system once more content is up. I hope this\n\nproves to be a helpful resource. If you're interested in getting in touch, you can contact me at\n\natmalik1331@gmail.com. You can also follow @opencatproject on Twitter for updates."}
